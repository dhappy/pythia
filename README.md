# ðŸ”¥ Pythia ðŸ”¥

At any given moment a person has a variety of competing alternatives for their next intention. Intention rather than action since often the world intervenes.

These intentions are frequently associated with goals. A user has multiple potentially competing goals.

## Use Case

Currently I am sitting in front of my computer. The setting is crucial in determining reasonable actions.

It is my intent to write some code. My overarching goal is something polished enough to publish and interersting enough to gain a following,

I am working on several different projects:

* Describing Pythia
* Adding a more graceful failure to git-remote-ipfs
* Import ISFDb series data into Argus
